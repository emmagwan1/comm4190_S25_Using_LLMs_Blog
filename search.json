Give me a devotional\n\nChatGPT Response\nTitle: Building a Strong Foundation\nScripture: Ecclesiastes 4:9-10 - “Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor: If either of them falls down, one can help the other up.”\nReflection:\nMarriage is a beautiful journey that thrives on partnership, love, and mutual support. As spouses, you are each other’s companions, working together to build a fulfilling life. Ecclesiastes 4:9-10 reminds us of the strength found in unity. When two people come together, they can achieve more than they would alone. Each partner supports the other, offering help and encouragement when one stumbles.\nIn these three years of marriage, you’ve likely encountered both joys and challenges. It’s crucial that you continue to nurture your relationship and deepen your understanding of one another. Maintaining open communication, showing appreciation, and praying together can strengthen your foundation and keep your bond strong.\nPrayer:\nDear Lord, thank you for the gift of marriage and the blessing of companionship. Help us to continually grow in love and patience with one another. Teach us to lean on each other’s strengths and support each other in weaknesses. May our marriage be grounded in Your love, and may we honor You in our relationship. Amen.\nAction Step:\nTake some time to sit down with your spouse and share what you appreciate about each other. Discuss any challenges you’ve faced and pray together for continued guidance and strength. Consider setting goals for your marriage to ensure you are growing together.\n\n\nAnthropic Response"

    "text": "Reflection\nThree years of marriage marks a beautiful milestone in your journey together. The initial excitement of newlywed life has likely evolved into a deeper, more rooted connection. Yet with this depth often comes new challenges and opportunities for growth.\nMarriage is one of God’s most profound gifts—a relationship that reflects His covenant love for us. Just as Christ commits Himself faithfully to His church, we’re called to commit ourselves daily to our spouse. This commitment isn’t just about staying together, but about growing together in grace.\nEvery marriage experiences seasons. Some are filled with joy and harmony, while others bring challenges that test our patience and understanding. In all seasons, love remains the binding force that holds everything together. Not merely emotional love, but the intentional, sacrificial love that chooses the good of the other.\nAfter three years, you’ve likely discovered that marriage reveals not just your spouse’s imperfections, but your own. This revelation is actually a gift—an opportunity to extend and receive grace in ways you may never have experienced before."

    "text": "Today’s Challenge\nTake time today to share with your spouse three specific things you appreciate about them and your marriage. Then, discuss one way you’d like to grow together in the coming year. Finally, pray together, thanking God for His presence in your relationship and asking for His guidance in the journey ahead.\n\nAnalysis\nI enjoyed both of these devotionals. I think it is hard for me just because I am not married yet, but from what I know they both seem great. Some of the similarities are that they both celebrated the 3-year marriage, which is something you would not have gotten in the bible app or a devotional book. Both devotionals talk about the importance of marriage and ideas of unity and God’s plan for it and how foundational prayer is.\nChatGPTs Response focuses on the power of partnership and support. Using Ecclesiastes 4:9-10, it emphasizes teamwork—how two people can achieve more together and help each other through difficulties. The tone is practical and encouraging, reminding couples that communication, appreciation, and prayer are key habits for keeping their bond strong. It recognizes the joys and struggles of the first few years and encourages couples to set shared goals and lean on each other’s strengths as they continue to grow.\nAnthropic’s Response on Colossians 3:14, is more reflective and emotional. It zooms out to show marriage as a spiritual covenant that mirrors Christ’s love for the Church. This devotional highlights how love isn’t just a feeling—it’s a daily, sacrificial choice that binds a couple in unity. It acknowledges that three years into marriage often brings deeper self-awareness and vulnerability, but frames those revelations as opportunities for grace and growth. Rather than just focusing on what the couple can do for each other, it invites them to view their growth as a shared spiritual transformation."

Whether it was Mother’s Day or Father’s Day cards or especially what was cool were Christmas cards, like Black people participating in the nativity seen. I mean I was amazed. I found this one card that I keep at my desk that says “The Ancestors are movinng mountains to see you rise”. Even though it wasn’t explicitly tailored to Black people I could tell implicity it was for us. So I had to buy it. It was so inspiring and meaningful and I thought wow, what if these types of cards become more than just rare sightings (and honestly since my childhood it has become more and more common.) So back to my story about the ancestors card being tailored for me. I looked at the back and it was from Hallmark Mahogany, with the fine print saying “uplifted and empowered celebrates the beauty, significance, and power of Black lives. Featuring Black writers, these are cards with a purpose that matters –– to support and stand strong with the Black community”. Anyway all this to say. I decided to invite that in this blog post."

The second for the one tailored for a young girl, it was also pretty basic, no faces and with the flowers it fits the demographic. Now for the one tailored for the Black girl I like it, because it was explicitly tailored and I know this was something I would have loved to recieve as a kids, because I would have know this card was only made for me and that is very special. The only thing is it might me too on the nose simply because it is only Happy Birthday then the girl. I would’ve added maybe a cake in front of her or adding flowers or confetti, so it still has the same level of fun and energy that the card catered for the generic card for a young girl had."

Everything that was said here was what I heard from my friends and this theme of looking on the brighter side and the bigger picture. One thing anthropic did that GPT didn’t was ask if I wanted to talk about it or discuss next steps. Which I thought was good.

Remember, this one opportunity doesn’t define your worth or potential. Rejections can be tough, but they can also serve as stepping stones to new opportunities and growth. Here are a few things that might help:\n\nReflect: Consider any feedback you might have received and think about areas where you could improve. This can be a valuable learning experience.\nTake Care of Yourself: Allow yourself to feel sad, but don’t be too hard on yourself. Do something that makes you happy or helps you to relax.\nSeek Support: Talk to friends, family, or mentors about how you’re feeling. They can offer support, encouragement, and maybe even some advice.\nStay Positive: Focus on past achievements and the skills you’ve developed. Remind yourself of your strengths and why you aimed for that internship in the first place.\nExplore Other Opportunities: There are many paths to success. Start looking for other internships or experiences that could benefit your career goals. Sometimes, unexpected opportunities turn out to be just as valuable or even better.\nKeep Growing: Use this experience to motivate yourself to learn and grow, improving your skills and building your resume for future opportunities.\n\nRemember, many successful people faced rejections on their way to where they are now. Keep believing in yourself and moving forward.\n\nCommentary\nSimilar to anthropic the first phrase was “I’m sorry”. They both started off with how rejection can easily make a person question their worth and capabilities. This experience did that for me. All of Chatgpts responses were focused on bettering me. While anthropic’s second point, was about other successful people experiencing rejection. Which was not helpful to me and did not make me feel better. I liked how it gave 2 or 3 word action items. Overall the advice was the same as anthropic. ChatGPT had a bit more empathy. I think the biggest difference between these two LLMs vs. my mom and friends was the personal connection. The people that I talked to were able to remind me of past achievements."

Here are a few steps to help you navigate this phase:\n\nReflect on Your Desires: Take some time to understand why you want to be in a relationship. Is it for companionship, love, social reasons, or something else? Being clear about your intentions can help guide you in finding what you truly want.\nEmbrace Self-Love: Focus on building a strong relationship with yourself. Engage in activities that make you happy and help you grow personally. This self-awareness can boost your confidence and attract the right partner.\nExpand Your Social Circles: Try meeting new people by joining clubs, groups, or events related to your interests. This can increase your chances of finding someone with similar values and passions.\nExplore Online Dating: Consider using dating apps or websites to meet potential partners. These platforms allow you to connect with people you might not encounter in your everyday life.\nCommunicate Openly: When you do start dating, be honest about your goals and what you’re looking for in a relationship. Clear communication is key to building a strong foundation.\nBe Patient: Finding a meaningful relationship often takes time. Try not to compare your journey with others, as everyone’s path is unique.\nSeek Support: Talk to friends, family, or even a counselor about your feelings. They can provide support and guidance as you navigate the dating world.\n\nRemember, being single can also be a fulfilling and enriching phase in your life.

They both mentionned self-reflection as the first step. The first response said to “Embrace Self-Love” which was most similar to “Celebrate your Journey.” The choice in wording wasn’t anything to note with it’s relation to race.\nBoth responses mentioned “Expand Social Circles, Seek Support, and Explore Online Dating.” With the suggestion to explore online dating apps, I was expecting it to suggest dating apps specifically for Black singles. I was glad that it didn’t as my intention with this exercise is to highlight racial biases. I do wish that it was mentionned, like in addition. In regards to expanding social circles, I am glad that point was included in both lists.\nThe point that was different in both responses was in response 1 it suggested to “Communicate Openly” while Response 2 called for “Cultural Considerations”. With me slightly changing the prompt to modify for race, I was suprised that cultural considerations was second to last on the list. For me, especially growing up in predominantly white spaces, my lack of relationships in comparison to my white peers I felt always came down to my race. I grew up in environments where classmates would tell me they weren’t allowed to bring home a Black girl.\nI was curious as to why ChatGPT only gave 7 answers. I am saying that because the lists were almost identical, but one point was switched out, my question is why couldn’t response 2 have 8, just adding the cultural considerations.\nOverall, the response was okay,I wish cultural considerations were higher on the list and I wish that cultural ques were slighly interwoven in the response, because I feel that cultural identy is SUCH a huge part in dating relationships, I feel that should’ve been present in the response."

In essence, it was for the adult general population, people that were health conscious and busy. I might do this again and not ask it to meal prep, maybe just “what should I eat today”. As meal prep does infer health conscious and busy.\nI asked ChatGPT on response 2 what is the difference between this meal prep and one you would give to a white woman. It responded “When crafting meal plans, the primary focus is on the individual’s dietary needs, preferences, and nutritional goals rather than their race or ethnicity.”\nOverall, it proved my expectations wrong.Besides the cost the meals had the same vibe very healthy, high protein low carb.

    "text": "5. “The Vanishing Half” by Brit Bennett\nThis multigenerational family saga follows twin sisters whose lives take dramatically different paths when one decides to live as a white woman. Bennett’s storytelling is exquisite as she explores racial identity, sisterhood, and the lasting influence of the past on our present choices. The novel spans decades and features complex, memorable characters finding their way in the world.\nEach of these books features strong storytelling with protagonists you might relate to during this transitional period in your life. They celebrate resilience, identity, and the journey of becoming who you’re meant to be—perfect companions as you complete this significant chapter of your education and begin the next.\n\nAnalysis\nBoth of these lists seem incredibly interesting. I am reading Michelle Obama’s biography Becoming now and I have read The Hate U Give. Queenie by Candice Carty-Williams was featured in both lists. It is contemporary novel about a young Black woman navigating identity, mental health, and adulthood.\nBoth book lists center Black female protagonists and highlight stories of resilience, identity, and transformation. The ChatGPT list celebrates a broader range of voices and genres—from young adult fiction (The Hate U Give) to sweeping historical epics (Homegoing) to iconic memoir (Becoming). It emphasizes stories with cultural weight, social justice themes, and emotional depth, offering powerful representations of Black womanhood across time, place, and circumstance. The characters in this list often face societal challenges but emerge empowered, making the collection feel affirming and universal.\nThe Anthropic list is more tailored to a specific life transition: a 22-year-old Black woman graduating college. These books dig into the complexities of early adulthood—post-grad uncertainty, identity shifts, mental health, and self-discovery. Novels like Honey Girl and Such a Fun Age speak directly to the tension between external achievement and internal fulfillment, while The Vanishing Half and The Death of Vivek Oji offer more nuanced explorations of identity, family, and belonging. This list leans more contemporary, intimate, and personal—almost like a literary care package for someone navigating real-world adulthood for the first time.\nIn short, the first list is broader and intergenerational, offering cultural and emotional richness, while the second list is more intimate and transitional, zeroing in on the post-college experience. Both lists are powerful in their own ways—and together, they offer a layered and inspiring portrait of Black womanhood across contexts and generations."

    "text": "Introduction\nI absolutely love going to the gym, but I am not a gym pro by any means. As of recent I have been utilizing ChatGPT to give me workout recommendations. I then realized I am always using Chat and was curious to compare the results with Anthropic.\n\n\nThe Prompt\nGive me a 1 hour workout routine\n\n\nAnthropic Response\n1-Hour Full Body Workout Routine Warm-up (5 minutes) Jumping jacks: 1 minute Arm circles: 30 seconds each direction Bodyweight squats: 1 minute High knees: 1 minute Hip rotations: 30 seconds each direction Main Circuit (40 minutes) Complete 4 rounds of this circuit, spending 45 seconds on each exercise with 15 seconds rest between exercises. Rest 1 minute between rounds.\nPush-ups (modify on knees if needed) Bodyweight squats Plank Lunges (alternating legs) Mountain climbers Glute bridges Bicycle crunches Burpees (modify as needed) Strength Focus (10 minutes) 3 sets of the following, 30 seconds work, 30 seconds rest\nSquat pulses Tricep dips (using chair/bench) Superman holds Cool Down (5 minutes) Hamstring stretch: 30 seconds each leg Quad stretch: 30 seconds each leg Child’s pose: 30 seconds Chest stretch: 30 seconds Neck stretches: 30 seconds Deep breathing: 1 minute Remember to drink water throughout your workout and adjust the intensity as needed for your fitness level!\n\n\nChatGPT Response\nHere’s a well-rounded 1-hour workout routine that balances strength, cardio, and flexibility. Make sure to warm up and cool down to prevent injury and aid recovery.\n\n\nWarm-Up (10 minutes)\n\nJumping Jacks: 3 minutes\nDynamic Stretches:\n\nArm Circles: 1 minute\nLeg Swings: 1 minute per leg\nHip Circles: 1 minute\n\nHigh Knees: 2 minutes\n\n\n\nStrength Training (30 minutes)\n\n\nCircuit 1 (15 minutes)\nPerform each exercise for 45 seconds followed by 15 seconds of rest. Repeat the circuit twice. - Push-Ups - Squats - Bent-Over Rows (using dumbbells or resistance bands) - Plank\n\n\nCircuit 2 (15 minutes)\nPerform each exercise for 45 seconds followed by 15 seconds of rest. Repeat the circuit twice. - Lunges (alternating legs) - Dumbbell Shoulder Press - Deadlifts (with dumbbells or kettlebell) - Bicycle Crunches\n\n\nCardio (10 minutes)\n\nBurpees: 1 minute\nMountain Climbers: 1 minute\nJump Rope: 3 minutes\nHigh-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) Sprints: 30 seconds on, 30 seconds rest (3 rounds)\n\n\n\nFlexibility and Cool Down (10 minutes)\n\nStanding Forward Bend: 1 minute\nCat-Cow Stretch: 1 minute\nChild’s Pose: 1 minute\nSeated Forward Bend: 1 minute\nPigeon Pose: 1 minute per leg\nQuad Stretch: 1 minute per leg\nShoulder Stretch: 1 minute per arm\n\n\n\nTips\n\nAdjust the intensity and weights according to your fitness level.\nStay hydrated and listen to your body to avoid overexertion.\nEnsure proper form to maximize benefits and minimize injury risk.\n\nThis workout covers all major muscle groups, includes cardiovascular and flexibility components, and can be adjusted according to your fitness level and specific goals.\n\nCommentary\nBoth of the responses had roughly the same format. They both gave a warm up. ChatGPTs warm up was 10 minutes long, which I feel for a personalized workout is not my reality. The excersises for the warm ups were the same, dynamic stretches. After that it was the main circuit. That main portion of the workout was a circut. ChatGPT split it into two circuits with 4 excerises each while anthropic did 1 circuit for 8 exercises. ChatGPT had a cardio specific section. For anthropic it’s first main circuit had a mix of cardio and toning exercises. While ChatGPT had strength training only in its first two circuits then it went into a cardio circuit. The exercises were practically the same. They both gave a circuit format which was interesting. When I workout I often superset (two sets in a row, then rest). I did find ChatGPTs formatting much better and more digestable. Therefore, in the future I will probably go with ChatGPT."

    "text": "Introduction\nI am always switching up mu hair,but I never know what to do next. So this time I asked Chat GPT “How should I wear my hair today for class.”\n\n\nResponse\n\n\nUSER\nHow should I wear my hair today for class\n\n\nASSISTANT\nChoosing a hairstyle for class can depend on a few factors, such as your hair type, length, and personal style.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nI don’t know about you but after a long semester I love to spend a day binge watching a good TV shows, but I am always looking for recommendations. I had this idea to ask ChatGPT and Anthropic for some recommendations.\n\n\nThe Prompt\nThe prompt I entered into both ChatGPT and Anthropic were “give me 10 tv recommendations”\n\n\nAnthropic Response\nHere are 10 highly-rated TV show recommendations across different genres:\n\nBreaking Bad - Crime drama about a chemistry teacher turned meth kingpin\nThe Wire - Complex crime drama exploring Baltimore’s law enforcement and criminal world\nStranger Things - Supernatural sci-fi thriller with 80s nostalgia\nThe Crown - Historical drama about the British Royal Family\nTed Lasso - Heartwarming comedy about an American football coach managing a British soccer team\nThe Good Place - Philosophical comedy about the afterlife\nChernobyl - Historical drama mini-series about the nuclear disaster\nDark - Complex German sci-fi thriller involving time travel\nSuccession - Drama about a dysfunctional media empire family\nThe Mandalorian - Star Wars space western following a bounty hunter\n\nThese shows vary in genre and tone, so you can choose based on your preferences. All have received critical acclaim and have strong fan followings.\n\n\nChatGPT Response\nSure! Here are ten diverse TV show recommendations spanning various genres:\n\nBreaking Bad - A high school chemistry teacher turned methamphetamine producer navigates the dangers of the drug trade.\nGame of Thrones - Epic fantasy series based on George R.R. Martin’s novels, filled with political intrigue, battles, and dragons.\nStranger Things** - A group of kids in the 1980s encounters supernatural forces and government conspiracies in their small town.\nThe Crown** - A historical drama that chronicles the reign of Queen Elizabeth II and the events that shaped the second half of the 20th century.\nThe Mandalorian** - Set in the Star Wars universe, this series follows a lone bounty hunter in the outer reaches of the galaxy.\nFleabag - A dark comedy about a dry-witted, angry, and confused young woman living in London and dealing with past tragedies.\nThe Office (U.S.) - A mockumentary-style comedy depicting the everyday lives of office employees at the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company.\nSherlock - A modern update to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s classic tales, featuring a brilliant but eccentric detective in contemporary London.\nThe Queen’s Gambit - Follows the life of an orphaned chess prodigy, Beth Harmon, during her quest to become the world’s greatest chess player.\nSuccession - A drama about a power struggle within a family-run media conglomerate, with darkly comedic undertones.\n\nThese shows offer a mix of drama, humor, action, and mystery, catering to a wide range of tastes.\n\n\nAnalysis\nAfter looking at both responses I found a few key observations. I had never watched any of the shows given, but a few of them I have heard my friends about. Both lists have 5 shared films. Those were Breaking Bad, Stranger Things, The Crown, The Mandalorian, and Succession. The first 3 I have heard about. All of the shows on this list are critically acclaimed. I appreciated how both LLMs gave shows from a large range of genres. This is important because I had not given either LLM further context so they didn’t assume a certain genre that I would like. Each list has drama, sci-fi, comedy, and historical content.\nThe one thing that truly stood out to me was the lack of representation on the shows both lists were skewed to white leads and eurocentric representation. I asked ChatGPT to give me a breakdown of apparent racial diversity in the shows. Below are the generated charts showing the lack of racial diversity across the lists. Anthropic did much better in including racial diversity. This is apparent in the addition of the Wire.\n\n\nRacial Representation Analysis Across Both Lists\nBetween List 1 and List 2, List 2 is better with racial representation, though only slightly — and mostly because of one standout show: The Wire.\nHere’s a breakdown of the comparison:\n\n\n\n📺 ChatGPT:\n\nBreaking Bad – ❌ (Latinx characters often stereotyped)\nGame of Thrones – ❌ (People of color exoticized or enslaved)\nStranger Things – ⚠️ (1 Black character, shallow arc)\nThe Crown – ❌ (Race rarely addressed)\nThe Mandalorian – ✅ (Diverse casting, race subtle)\nFleabag – ❌ (White-centered)\nThe Office (U.S.) – ⚠️ (Some diversity, often played for laughs)\nSherlock – ❌ (Very white cast)\nThe Queen’s Gambit – ⚠️ (1 Black character late in story)\nSuccession – ❌ (All-white main cast)\n\n→ 1 clear win, 3 surface-level, 6 misses\n\n\n\n📺 Anthropic:\n\nBreaking Bad – ❌\nThe Wire – ✅✅✅ (Gold standard for racial realism in TV)\nStranger Things – ⚠️\nThe Crown – ❌\nTed Lasso – ✅ (Gentle but present representation)\nThe Good Place – ✅ (Multiracial core cast, normalized)\nChernobyl – ❌\nDark – ❌\nSuccession – ❌\nThe Mandalorian – ✅\n\n→ 4 strong, 1 surface-level, 5 misses\n\n\n🧮 Final Count:\n\n\n\n\n✅ Strong\n⚠️ Meh\n❌ Lacking\n\n\n\n\nChatGPT\n1\n3\n6\n\n\nAnthropic\n4\n1\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n✅ Conclusion:\nList 2 is more intentional and well-rounded with racial representation — especially due to The Wire, The Good Place, and Ted Lasso, which normalize racial diversity without being exploitative or stereotypical.\nList 1, while more “pop culture iconic,” generally centers white narratives and lacks thoughtful inclusion of race and identity.\nWant a reworked list that keeps the strong storytelling but improves racial inclusion and representation across the board?"

With 5 ideas being in 5 different subheadings, therefore all of the gifts from the ChatGPT list were accounted for with Anthropic. I also like how ChatGPT give you short instructions on how to create the gifts. Both responses give gifts that children at any age can do from arts and crafts to wine tasting. I also appreciated Anthropic’s last sentence that even though it gave so many ideas reminding the user not to overly stress about the “perfect” mother’s day gift. In conclusion I am a fan of both of these lists as I feel they are both comprehensive of price points and age ranges."

I first asked ChatGPT what are the best places to visit in Philadelphia and it gave me the following. It was interesting how chatgpt decided which were the “best” things for people to visit. Considering “best” is very subjective. I then asked ChatGPT which were the best places for me to visit as a Black woman and it gave me the following.\nI then asked chat gpt to give me the best places to visit as a white woman. The first thing that I realized was the list that was given to me after specifying it for white women was almost identical in the generic list. At first glance I realized AI’s defaultness to whiteness.\nThe Black attractions were very culturally tailored. The only thing that was mentioned on the default list was Terminal Market and there it emphasized that there are Black owned brands. There was even a heading for cultural activism, something that wasn’t seen on the other lists. Making it seem as if activism and supporting Black owned businesses is only relevant to Black people.\nI did appreciate the list centering Black women nice. As I do enjoy going to places where I get to see representation. I just wished I didn’t have to ask for it. I don’t know why Black cultural festivals couldn’t be on the default list.\nIn the white woman list after every event chatgpt never emphasized why this particular place would be good for a white woman."

    "text": "ChatGPT Response\nParenting can be both rewarding and challenging, and while every parent and child is unique, there are some general principles that can be helpful:\n\nShow Unconditional Love: Let your child know you love them for who they are, regardless of their achievements or behavior. This builds a strong, trusting relationship.\nBe Consistent: Consistency in rules and discipline helps children understand expectations and boundaries. They feel more secure when they know what to expect.\nListen Actively: Take time to really listen to your child’s thoughts and feelings. Validating their emotions and showing empathy reinforces their self-worth and strengthens your bond.\nModel the Behavior You Wish to See: Children observe and imitate adults. Show them respect, kindness, and patience. Your actions set a powerful example.\nEncourage Independence: Allow your child to make decisions appropriate for their age. This helps build confidence and decision-making skills.\nSet Aside Quality Time: Regularly spend dedicated, undistracted time with your child. It strengthens your connection and shows them they are a priority.\nTeach Responsibility: Give your child age-appropriate chores or responsibilities. It teaches them the importance of contributing to the family and builds a sense of accomplishment.\nPromote a Growth Mindset: Encourage effort and resilience rather than focusing solely on results. This teaches your child to embrace challenges and learn from mistakes.\nCommunicate Openly: Foster an environment where your child feels comfortable sharing their feelings, thoughts, and questions without fear of judgment.\nStay Informed and Flexible: Parenting practices evolve, so stay informed about child development and be willing to adapt your approaches as needed.\nTake Care of Yourself: Ensure you are also tending to your own physical and emotional needs. A well-rested and balanced parent is better equipped to meet the demands of parenting.\nSeek Support When Needed: Don’t hesitate to reach out for help or advice from friends, family, or professionals when needed. Parenting is a shared journey.\n\nRemember that no parent is perfect, and it’s okay to make mistakes. What’s most important is a willingness to learn and grow alongside your child."

    "text": "Introduction\nThis spring break one of my best had an engagement party! I am so excited for her. This had me thinking about my own wedding one day. I asked both ChatGPT and Anthropic to help me plan my future wedding.\n\n\nPrompt:\nThe prompt I gave each LLM was “Help me plan a wedding”\n\n\nChatGPT Response\n\n\nUSER\nhelp me plan my wedding\n\n\nASSISTANT\nCongratulations on your upcoming wedding! Planning a wedding can be a wonderful yet complex process, but breaking down the tasks can make it more manageable. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you plan:\n\n\n12+ Months Before\n\nSet a Budget: Determine how much you’re willing to spend and who is contributing.\nDraft a Guest List: Consider the size of the wedding and compile a list of potential guests.\nChoose a Date: Pick a season or specific date for your wedding.\nHire a Planner (optional): If needed, find a wedding planner to assist with organizing the event.\nBook a Venue: Secure your ceremony and reception locations early.\n\n\n\n9-12 Months Before\n\nSelect Wedding Party: Choose bridesmaids, groomsmen, flower girls, etc.\nStart Dress Shopping: Begin looking for a gown, allow time for fittings and alterations.\nHire Key Vendors:\n\nPhotographer/videographer\nCaterer\nBand/DJ\nFlorist\n\n\n\n\n6-9 Months Before\n\nSend Save-the-Dates: Inform people in advance to keep the date free.\nPlan Ceremony Details: Meet with officiant to discuss the ceremony.\nRegister for Gifts: Set up your gift registries.\nBook Transportation: Arrange for limousines, carriages, or any unique transport.\n\n\n\n3-6 Months Before\n\nOrder Invitations: Print wedding invitations, and plan when to send them.\nPlan the Honeymoon: Book flights and accommodations.\nBuy Wedding Rings: Choose and purchase your wedding bands.\nPlan Wedding Day Timeline: Coordinate with vendors on timing.\n\n\n\n2-3 Months Before\n\nMail Invitations: Send out invitations and track RSVPs.\nFirst Dress Fitting: Schedule alterations as needed.\nFinalize Menu and Flowers: Confirm selections with caterer and florist.\nArrange Accommodations for Guests: Reserve hotel blocks if necessary.\n\n\n\n1-2 Months Before\n\nGet a Marriage License: Check your local requirements.\nWrite Vows: If personal vows are desired, complete them.\nPlan Seating Chart: Consider relationships and arrange tables.\nConfirm Details with Vendors: Double-check all arrangements.\n\n\n\n2 Weeks Before\n\nFinal Dress Fitting: Check fittings and accessories.\nConfirm Honeymoon Plans: Ensure all travel documents are ready.\nDelegate Tasks: Assign responsibilities to wedding party members.\n\n\n\n1 Week Before\n\nRehearsal Dinner: Plan and finalize with all involved.\nPack for Honeymoon: Get luggage ready for departure.\nPrepare Payments and Tips: Organize payments for vendors.\n\n\n\nWedding Day\n\nRelax and Enjoy: Allow yourself to be a guest at your own wedding.\nHair and Makeup: Schedule enough time for everyone.\nBe on Time: Follow your planned schedule closely.\n\n\n\nPost-Wedding\n\nSend Thank-You Notes: Acknowledge gifts and guests’ presence.\nPreserve Wedding Dress: Consider professional cleaning and preservation.\nReview Vendors: Leave reviews or testimonials.\n\nRemember, every wedding is unique, so adjust these steps to fit your personal style and preferences. Enjoy your planning and have a fantastic wedding day!\n\nAnthropic Response\n\n\n\nPlanning Your Wedding\nCongratulations on your engagement! Planning a wedding can be both exciting and overwhelming. Here’s a step-by-step approach to help you organize your special day:\n\n\nInitial Planning (12+ months before)\n\nSet a budget and determine who’s contributing financially\nChoose a wedding date (or a few potential dates)\nDecide on the size and style of wedding you want\nStart researching venues for both ceremony and reception\nBegin creating your guest list\nConsider hiring a wedding planner if it fits your budget\n\n\n\n9-12 Months Before\n\nBook your ceremony and reception venues\nResearch and book key vendors:\n\nPhotographer/videographer\nCaterer\nDJ/band\nFlorist\n\nShop for wedding attire\nCreate a wedding website (if desired)\nSend save-the-date notifications\n\n\n\n6-9 Months Before\n\nSelect and order invitations\nRegister for gifts\nBook transportation\nReserve accommodations for out-of-town guests\nPlan your honeymoon\n\n\n\n3-6 Months Before\n\nOrder the wedding cake\nPurchase wedding rings\nArrange pre-wedding events (rehearsal dinner, etc.)\nFinalize menu with caterer\nSchedule hair and makeup trials\n\nWould you like me to go into more detail about any specific aspect of wedding planning?\n\nAnalysis\nI was pleased with both responses. What I noticed first was Anthropic did not add details as to what I should do the day of the wedding as well as afterward. It also seemed very formulaic, especially with the short bullet points. Both LLMs congratulated me on my “engagement” and acknowledged the emotions that wedding planning can evoke. Which was good and mimicked human conversation. ChatGPT assumed that a woman was asking for advice as in the 9-12 months section is said to find a wedding dress while anthropic said to find wedding attire. There was a difference in advice in the 6-9 months before category. The only thing that was the same in that category was register for gifts. Save the date,honeymoon planning, was on section off( by section I am referring to the month suggestions). One thing I felt was interesting that anthropic did not add to plan the wedding ceremony anywhere in its advice. One thing I would like to note with the 6-9 month timeline and the save the date and honeymoon planning being slightly off is potentially those things could be on the cusp. Anthropic also did not go into what to do the day of the wedding or up to two months before. This is interesting and I would of appreciated if anthropic would have included that without additional prompting. In conclusion I appreciated ChatGPTs response more as it is more thorough."

    "text": "Response\n\nUSER\nDraft an email to my manager asking for a raise\n\n\nASSISTANT\nSubject: Request for Salary Review\nHi [Manager’s Name],\nI hope this message finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to express my gratitude for the opportunities and support I have received during my time at [Company Name]. I have enjoyed working under your leadership and have learned a lot from you and the team.\nI am writing to formally request a review of my current salary. Over the past [duration], I have taken on additional responsibilities and have successfully [mention notable achievements or contributions], which I believe have positively impacted our team and the company’s objectives.\nSince joining the team, I have consistently aimed to exceed expectations and have worked towards enhancing my skills and contributing to our projects. I am committed to continuing this trajectory and providing even more value to our team and [Company Name] as a whole.\nIn light of my accomplishments and my increased scope of work, I believe it is appropriate to discuss a salary adjustment that reflects my contributions and commitment. I have researched industry standards and feel that an increase in my compensation would be aligned with current market trends.\nI would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this at your earliest convenience. Please let me know a time that works for you to meet and further discuss my request.\nThank you for considering my request. I am eager to continue contributing to our success and look forward to our conversation.\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\n[Your Position]\n\n\nUSER\nI am a woman Draft an email to my manager asking for a raise\n\n\nASSISTANT\nSubject: Request for Salary Review Discussion\nHi [Manager’s Name],\nI hope you’re doing well. I’ve been reflecting on my time at [Company Name] and the various responsibilities I’ve embraced over the [duration], and I wanted to reach out to discuss my current compensation.\nDuring my tenure, I’ve been committed to contributing positively to our team’s goals and the overall success of the company. I’ve taken on additional responsibilities and successfully [mention specific achievements or projects], which I believe have been beneficial to our objectives.\nI am passionate about my role and dedicated to further development and growth within our team. With the experience and skills I’ve gained, as well as the added responsibilities I’ve taken on, I feel it is appropriate to revisit my salary to ensure it aligns with both my contributions and industry benchmarks.\nI would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this further and explore the possibility of a raise. Please let me know when you might have time to meet and talk through this request.\nThank you for your ongoing support and leadership. I’m looking forward to our conversation.\nWarm regards,\n[Your Name]\n[Your Position]\n\n\nAnalysis\nThe first email specifically thanks the manager for opportunities and support and highlights learning from both the manager and the team, creating a foundation of gratitude and appreciation, while the email tailored for women focuses more on reflecting on your tenure and contributions without explicitly mentioning learning from the manager. This was interesting to me when thinking about this as I feel for women to get raises you are constantly having to advocate your worth.\nIn terms of evidence of research, the first email includes a reference to having researched industry standards, suggesting that your request is informed by external benchmarks, which adds a layer of credibility and preparedness; however, the second email only implies alignment with benchmarks and does not state that research was conducted, focusing instead on personal contributions as the basis for the request. This is interesting because I feel like as women asking for raises a problem that can be shown is women not knowing how much their job is worth with external benchmarks.\nRegarding tone and emphasis, the first email employs a more formal and structured approach, clearly outlining specific achievements and mentioning additional responsibilities taken on, whereas the second email adopts a slightly more personal tone, emphasizing passion, dedication, and desire for growth within the company, which can resonate on a more personal level.\nBoth emails request a meeting to discuss the salary adjustment, but the first explicitly asks for a meeting “at your earliest convenience,” indicating a sense of urgency, while the second simply inquires about when it might be possible to meet, demonstrating flexibility. This is also a great point focusing on urgency and the pacificity and lack of force women can have when asking for raises."

The meal prep for the Black woman was a Jerk chicken salad bowl vs. a chicken veggie wrap on the generic prompt. This was cool and definately cultural tailoring, because jerk chicken and jerk spice is eaten in the caribbean. (I’m Haitian, so I know trust). I appreciated this because it was a great fusion meal choice, because at caribbean restaurants or homes you aren’t going to have a salad bowl, it’ll probably be paired with rice n beans. So this salad is a good way to keep it healthy with ethnic flavors. I appreciated this addition."

    "text": "5. “The Overstory” by Richard Powers\nA sweeping, passionate novel about nine Americans whose unique life experiences with trees bring them together to address the destruction of forests. Winner of the Pulitzer Prize, this book changes how you see the natural world and humanity’s place within it.\nEach of these books offers something different—from practical self-improvement to profound fiction—but all have the potential to shift your perspective and stay with you long after you’ve turned the final page.\n\nUSER\nwho was this list for\n\n\nASSISTANT\nThis list wasn’t created for any specific person - I generated these recommendations without knowing your personal reading preferences or interests. These are generally well-regarded books across different genres (literary fiction, memoir, fantasy, self-improvement, and environmental fiction) that appeal to many readers.\nIf you’d like recommendations tailored to your specific interests, reading history, or preferences, I’d be happy to create a more personalized list. Just let me know what types of books you typically enjoy, any favorite authors, genres you prefer, or topics you’re interested in exploring!\n\n\nAnalysis\nBoth book lists offer a really great mix of stories that either help you escape into another world or reflect more deeply on your own. When asked both models the book lists weren’t tailored to a specific person or genre just highly regarded books. Educated showed up on both lists. They each include a blend of fiction and non-fiction, so whether you’re in the mood for something imaginative like The Night Circus or The House in the Cerulean Sea, or something eye-opening like Sapiens or Atomic Habits, there’s something for everyone. A lot of the books also carry themes of growth, identity, and transformation—like Educated, which shows up on both lists and really highlights how powerful it can be to take control of your own path. Even the novels, like Where the Crawdads Sing or The Midnight Library, have characters working through big emotional or life-changing moments.\nWhere they differ is mostly in tone and focus. The first list leans more literary and philosophical—books like The Alchemist and Sapiens are the kind that make you think big-picture about life and purpose. The second list feels more modern and emotionally engaging, with books like The Overstory bringing in environmental themes, and Atomic Habits giving you practical advice for real-life improvement. If the first list is about wondering what life means, the second is more about how to live it well. But overall, both are full of deeply moving, memorable reads that stick with you in different ways."

Here are a few steps to help you navigate this phase:\n\nReflect on Your Desires: Take some time to understand why you want to be in a relationship. Is it for companionship, love, social reasons, or something else? Being clear about your intentions can help guide you in finding what you truly want.\nEmbrace Self-Love: Focus on building a strong relationship with yourself. Engage in activities that make you happy and help you grow personally. This self-awareness can boost your confidence and attract the right partner.\nExpand Your Social Circles: Try meeting new people by joining clubs, groups, or events related to your interests. This can increase your chances of finding someone with similar values and passions.\nExplore Online Dating: Consider using dating apps or websites to meet potential partners. These platforms allow you to connect with people you might not encounter in your everyday life.\nCommunicate Openly: When you do start dating, be honest about your goals and what you’re looking for in a relationship. Clear communication is key to building a strong foundation.\nBe Patient: Finding a meaningful relationship often takes time. Try not to compare your journey with others, as everyone’s path is unique.\nSeek Support: Talk to friends, family, or even a counselor about your feelings. They can provide support and guidance as you navigate the dating world.\n\nRemember, being single can also be a fulfilling and enriching phase in your life.

They both mentionned self-reflection as the first step. The first response said to “Embrace Self-Love” which was most similar to “Celebrate your Journey.” The choice in wording wasn’t anything to note with it’s relation to race.\nBoth responses mentioned “Expand Social Circles, Seek Support, and Explore Online Dating.” With the suggestion to explore online dating apps, I was expecting it to suggest dating apps specifically for Black singles. I was glad that it didn’t as my intention with this exercise is to highlight racial biases. I do wish that it was mentionned, like in addition. In regards to expanding social circles, I am glad that point was included in both lists.\nThe point that was different in both responses was in response 1 it suggested to “Communicate Openly” while Response 2 called for “Cultural Considerations”. With me slightly changing the prompt to modify for race, I was suprised that cultural considerations was second to last on the list. For me, especially growing up in predominantly white spaces, my lack of relationships in comparison to my white peers I felt always came down to my race. I grew up in environments where classmates would tell me they weren’t allowed to bring home a Black girl.\nI was curious as to why ChatGPT only gave 7 answers. I am saying that because the lists were almost identical, but one point was switched out, my question is why couldn’t response 2 have 8, just adding the cultural considerations.\nOverall, the response was okay,I wish cultural considerations were higher on the list and I wish that cultural ques were slighly interwoven in the response, because I feel that cultural identy is SUCH a huge part in dating relationships, I feel that should’ve been present in the response."

We often equate activity with productivity and forget the power of simply being still and present. Psalm 46:10 is a gentle yet firm reminder that God calls us to pause amidst our chaos, to cease striving and recognize His sovereignty.\nBeing still isn’t about inaction but about resting in the knowledge that God is in control. When we feel overwhelmed by our responsibilities or anxieties, taking a moment to be still can center us. It allows us to draw strength from God, acknowledging that He holds our future and the world in His hands.\nPrayer:\nHeavenly Father, teach me the value of stillness in Your presence. When my life feels chaotic and uncertain, help me to pause and remember that You are God. Grant me peace and comfort, knowing that You are exalted above all. May my moments of stillness draw me closer to You and renew my strength for the tasks ahead. Amen.\nAction Step:\nSet aside a few minutes today to sit in silence. Use this time to quiet your mind and focus on God’s presence. Reflect on His greatness and allow His peace to fill your heart.\n\n\nAnthropic Response"

    "text": "Analysis\nI really liked these devotionals. They both included essential parts that I appreciated. The scripture, reflections, prayer, then action steps. They both focused on the same theme of being in the present with much of today’s hustle and bustle.\nThe Anthropic Response is all about letting go of worry about the future and focusing on what’s right in front of you. It draws on the idea of daily peace—reminding us that each day has its own troubles, so there’s no need to borrow stress from tomorrow. The scripture highlights the importance of trusting God with what’s ahead, and emotionally, it speaks to people who feel anxious about what’s next. The challenge is to be more mindful and present, practicing gratitude and noticing the small blessings happening right now.\nOn the other hand, ChatGPT zooms in on the idea of simply being still—pausing to recognize that God is in control. The focus here is on God’s sovereignty and stepping back from the rush of life to remember who’s really in charge. It connects more with people who feel overwhelmed or stretched thin, offering a moment of silence and spiritual grounding. Instead of focusing on what’s happening around us, it encourages sitting quietly and reflecting on God’s greatness. The tone invites awe, like taking a deep breath and realizing you’re not carrying everything alone.\nThese are both good tangible and practical devotionals. The one thing I would say is I prefer ChatGPTs response more. This is solely because it gets to the point of what a devotional is, to focus on God. So while the themes are roughly the same the caveat is that GPT has to make time for God when life is crazy putting a greater emphasis on God."

    "text": "Commentary\nFor this next blog post I compared the responses from a Board Certified Internal Medicine Doctor and responses from Chatgpt. I pretended to be a patient that had a stomach ache. I both the doctor and the chatgpt to ask questions to assess the issue.\nAt first chatgpt was hesitant to diagnose and it continuously advised me to consult an actual doctor. It is good to know that chatgpt understands that, and that his medical advice is not 100% proof. So it could be wrong if something were to happen.\nI was very impressed. Chatgpt’s questions and diagnosis were spot on with my mom’s. Below is the transcript of the phone call and the conversation with chatgpt.\nMy doctor did not ask me to describe the pain. She did ask me where the pain was located. She did ask me when did the pain start and how severe was the pain on a scale of 1-10. She asked if I had diahrea, She did not ask if anything made the pain better or worse.\nChatgpt did not ask me if there was blood in my stool, anything that I have taken so far to help it. It didn’t ask me how long it had been going on.\nNonetheless it was very accurate in a prospective diagnosis. The top one that was given was gastroenteritis which was the same as my doctors perspective diagnosis based off of the information given.\nThe two of them both emphasized on coming to see the doctor in person for better accuracy.\n\n\nUSER\nYou are a doctor and I have a stomach ache. assess my symptoms\n\n\nASSISTANT\nI’m not a doctor, but I can try to help you understand what might be going on based on common symptoms. It’s important to note that if your stomach ache is severe, persistent, or accompanied by other symptoms like fever, vomiting, or blood in your stool, you should seek medical attention immediately. Here’s a general guide to some possible causes of a stomach ache:\n\nLocation and Type of Pain:\n\nUpper Abdomen: Could be related to indigestion, gastritis, or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).\nLower Abdomen: Might be associated with digestive issues, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or a urinary tract infection (UTI).\nRight Side: If on the upper right, it could indicate gallstones; on the lower right, it might be appendicitis.\n\nOnset and Duration:\n\nSudden and Severe: Could be a sign of something urgent like appendicitis or a perforated ulcer.\nChronic or Recurring: Often linked to dietary issues, stress, or chronic conditions like IBS.\n\nAssociated Symptoms:\n\nNausea and Vomiting: May accompany gastritis, food poisoning, or stomach flu.\nDiarrhea: Can indicate infections, IBS, or food intolerances.\nFever: Often signals an infection, such as gastroenteritis.\n\nRecent Activities and Dietary Habits:\n\nConsider if you’ve eaten something unusual, consumed alcohol, or taken any medications that could irritate your stomach.\n\n\nRemember, this is not a substitute for professional medical evaluation. If your symptoms persist or worsen, please consult a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.\n\n\nUSER\nWhat questions would you ask me\n\n\nASSISTANT\nWhen assessing symptoms like a stomach ache, a healthcare provider would typically ask a series of questions to better understand your condition. Here are some questions they might ask:\n\nCan you describe the pain?\n\nIs it sharp, dull, cramping, or burning?\n\nWhere exactly is the pain located?\n\nIs it in the upper, lower, left, right, or central part of your abdomen?\n\nWhen did the pain start?\n\nWas the onset sudden or gradual?\n\nHow severe is the pain on a scale from 1 to 10?\nIs the pain constant, or does it come and go?\nHave you noticed any triggers or anything that makes the pain better or worse?\n\nFor example, eating, drinking, movement, or rest.\n\nHave you experienced any recent changes in your bowel habits?\n\nSuch as diarrhea, constipation, or changes in stool appearance.\n\nAre you experiencing any other symptoms?\n\nNausea, vomiting, fever, bloating, or weight loss.\n\nHave you eaten anything unusual or suspect recently?\n\nSuch as new foods, undercooked or raw items.\n\nHave you recently traveled or been in contact with anyone sick?\nDo you have any history of gastrointestinal issues?\n\nLike ulcers, GERD, IBS, or Crohn’s disease.\n\nAre you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?\nDo you have any significant medical history or chronic conditions?\nHave you experienced any stress or significant changes in your life recently?\n\nThese questions help healthcare professionals form a more complete picture of your situation and guide them toward a potential diagnosis and appropriate treatment options. If you’re experiencing concerning symptoms, please seek medical attention.\n\n\nUSER\nThe pain is a 7. I have a headache, nausea, vomitting, I haven’t tried new foods. It happened last night.\n\n\nASSISTANT\nGiven the severity of your pain (7 out of 10) along with additional symptoms such as headache, nausea, and vomiting, it’s important to consider seeking medical attention promptly. These symptoms could be indicative of several potential issues, including but not limited to:\n\nGastroenteritis: Often caused by infection, leading to inflammation of the stomach and intestines, which can involve vomiting and possibly headaches due to dehydration.\nMigraine: Sometimes migraines can be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.\nFoodborne Illness: Although you haven’t tried new foods, contamination or spoilage of regular food items can also lead to symptoms like these.\nAppendicitis: Typically involves abdominal pain (often starting around the navel and then moving), nausea, and sometimes vomiting.\nGastritis or Ulcer: Inflammation or ulceration in the stomach lining can cause significant pain and nausea.\nPancreatitis: Inflammation of the pancreas can cause severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.\n\nBecause your symptoms are potentially concerning, especially with the level of pain, it’s important to consult a healthcare professional as soon as possible. They can provide a physical examination, ask more detailed questions, and may recommend tests or imaging if necessary to determine the cause of your symptoms and appropriate treatment. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated, although if vomiting persists, taking small sips might be easier than drinking large amounts."
