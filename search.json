    "text": "Commentary\nFor this next blog post I compared the responses from a Board Certified Internal Medicine Doctor and responses from Chatgpt. I pretended to be a patient that had a stomach ache. I both the doctor and the chatgpt to ask questions to assess the issue.\nAt first chatgpt was hesitant to diagnose and it continuously advised me to consult an actual doctor. It is good to know that chatgpt understands that, and that his medical advice is not 100% proof. So it could be wrong if something were to happen.\nI was very impressed. Chatgpt’s questions and diagnosis were spot on with my mom’s. Below is the transcript of the phone call and the conversation with chatgpt.\nMy doctor did not ask me to describe the pain. She did ask me where the pain was located. She did ask me when did the pain start and how severe was the pain on a scale of 1-10. She asked if I had diahrea, She did not ask if anything made the pain better or worse.\nChatgpt did not ask me if there was blood in my stool, anything that I have taken so far to help it. It didn’t ask me how long it had been going on.\nNonetheless it was very accurate in a prospective diagnosis. The top one that was given was gastroenteritis which was the same as my doctors perspective diagnosis based off of the information given.\nThe two of them both emphasized on coming to see the doctor in person for better accuracy.\n\n\nUSER\nYou are a doctor and I have a stomach ache. assess my symptoms\n\n\nASSISTANT\nI’m not a doctor, but I can try to help you understand what might be going on based on common symptoms. It’s important to note that if your stomach ache is severe, persistent, or accompanied by other symptoms like fever, vomiting, or blood in your stool, you should seek medical attention immediately. Here’s a general guide to some possible causes of a stomach ache:\n\nLocation and Type of Pain:\n\nUpper Abdomen: Could be related to indigestion, gastritis, or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).\nLower Abdomen: Might be associated with digestive issues, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or a urinary tract infection (UTI).\nRight Side: If on the upper right, it could indicate gallstones; on the lower right, it might be appendicitis.\n\nOnset and Duration:\n\nSudden and Severe: Could be a sign of something urgent like appendicitis or a perforated ulcer.\nChronic or Recurring: Often linked to dietary issues, stress, or chronic conditions like IBS.\n\nAssociated Symptoms:\n\nNausea and Vomiting: May accompany gastritis, food poisoning, or stomach flu.\nDiarrhea: Can indicate infections, IBS, or food intolerances.\nFever: Often signals an infection, such as gastroenteritis.\n\nRecent Activities and Dietary Habits:\n\nConsider if you’ve eaten something unusual, consumed alcohol, or taken any medications that could irritate your stomach.\n\n\nRemember, this is not a substitute for professional medical evaluation. If your symptoms persist or worsen, please consult a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.\n\n\nUSER\nWhat questions would you ask me\n\n\nASSISTANT\nWhen assessing symptoms like a stomach ache, a healthcare provider would typically ask a series of questions to better understand your condition. Here are some questions they might ask:\n\nCan you describe the pain?\n\nIs it sharp, dull, cramping, or burning?\n\nWhere exactly is the pain located?\n\nIs it in the upper, lower, left, right, or central part of your abdomen?\n\nWhen did the pain start?\n\nWas the onset sudden or gradual?\n\nHow severe is the pain on a scale from 1 to 10?\nIs the pain constant, or does it come and go?\nHave you noticed any triggers or anything that makes the pain better or worse?\n\nFor example, eating, drinking, movement, or rest.\n\nHave you experienced any recent changes in your bowel habits?\n\nSuch as diarrhea, constipation, or changes in stool appearance.\n\nAre you experiencing any other symptoms?\n\nNausea, vomiting, fever, bloating, or weight loss.\n\nHave you eaten anything unusual or suspect recently?\n\nSuch as new foods, undercooked or raw items.\n\nHave you recently traveled or been in contact with anyone sick?\nDo you have any history of gastrointestinal issues?\n\nLike ulcers, GERD, IBS, or Crohn’s disease.\n\nAre you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?\nDo you have any significant medical history or chronic conditions?\nHave you experienced any stress or significant changes in your life recently?\n\nThese questions help healthcare professionals form a more complete picture of your situation and guide them toward a potential diagnosis and appropriate treatment options. If you’re experiencing concerning symptoms, please seek medical attention.\n\n\nUSER\nThe pain is a 7. I have a headache, nausea, vomitting, I haven’t tried new foods. It happened last night.\n\n\nASSISTANT\nGiven the severity of your pain (7 out of 10) along with additional symptoms such as headache, nausea, and vomiting, it’s important to consider seeking medical attention promptly. These symptoms could be indicative of several potential issues, including but not limited to:\n\nGastroenteritis: Often caused by infection, leading to inflammation of the stomach and intestines, which can involve vomiting and possibly headaches due to dehydration.\nMigraine: Sometimes migraines can be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.\nFoodborne Illness: Although you haven’t tried new foods, contamination or spoilage of regular food items can also lead to symptoms like these.\nAppendicitis: Typically involves abdominal pain (often starting around the navel and then moving), nausea, and sometimes vomiting.\nGastritis or Ulcer: Inflammation or ulceration in the stomach lining can cause significant pain and nausea.\nPancreatitis: Inflammation of the pancreas can cause severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.\n\nBecause your symptoms are potentially concerning, especially with the level of pain, it’s important to consult a healthcare professional as soon as possible. They can provide a physical examination, ask more detailed questions, and may recommend tests or imaging if necessary to determine the cause of your symptoms and appropriate treatment. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated, although if vomiting persists, taking small sips might be easier than drinking large amounts."

    "text": "Introduction\nI absolutely love going to the gym, but I am not a gym pro by any means. As of recent I have been utilizing ChatGPT to give me workout recommendations. I then realized I am always using Chat and was curious to compare the results with Anthropic.\n\n\nThe Prompt\nGive me a 1 hour workout routine\n\n\nAnthropic Response\n1-Hour Full Body Workout Routine Warm-up (5 minutes) Jumping jacks: 1 minute Arm circles: 30 seconds each direction Bodyweight squats: 1 minute High knees: 1 minute Hip rotations: 30 seconds each direction Main Circuit (40 minutes) Complete 4 rounds of this circuit, spending 45 seconds on each exercise with 15 seconds rest between exercises. Rest 1 minute between rounds.\nPush-ups (modify on knees if needed) Bodyweight squats Plank Lunges (alternating legs) Mountain climbers Glute bridges Bicycle crunches Burpees (modify as needed) Strength Focus (10 minutes) 3 sets of the following, 30 seconds work, 30 seconds rest\nSquat pulses Tricep dips (using chair/bench) Superman holds Cool Down (5 minutes) Hamstring stretch: 30 seconds each leg Quad stretch: 30 seconds each leg Child’s pose: 30 seconds Chest stretch: 30 seconds Neck stretches: 30 seconds Deep breathing: 1 minute Remember to drink water throughout your workout and adjust the intensity as needed for your fitness level!\n\n\nChatGPT Response\nHere’s a well-rounded 1-hour workout routine that balances strength, cardio, and flexibility. Make sure to warm up and cool down to prevent injury and aid recovery.\n\n\nWarm-Up (10 minutes)\n\nJumping Jacks: 3 minutes\nDynamic Stretches:\n\nArm Circles: 1 minute\nLeg Swings: 1 minute per leg\nHip Circles: 1 minute\n\nHigh Knees: 2 minutes\n\n\n\nStrength Training (30 minutes)\n\n\nCircuit 1 (15 minutes)\nPerform each exercise for 45 seconds followed by 15 seconds of rest. Repeat the circuit twice. - Push-Ups - Squats - Bent-Over Rows (using dumbbells or resistance bands) - Plank\n\n\nCircuit 2 (15 minutes)\nPerform each exercise for 45 seconds followed by 15 seconds of rest. Repeat the circuit twice. - Lunges (alternating legs) - Dumbbell Shoulder Press - Deadlifts (with dumbbells or kettlebell) - Bicycle Crunches\n\n\nCardio (10 minutes)\n\nBurpees: 1 minute\nMountain Climbers: 1 minute\nJump Rope: 3 minutes\nHigh-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) Sprints: 30 seconds on, 30 seconds rest (3 rounds)\n\n\n\nFlexibility and Cool Down (10 minutes)\n\nStanding Forward Bend: 1 minute\nCat-Cow Stretch: 1 minute\nChild’s Pose: 1 minute\nSeated Forward Bend: 1 minute\nPigeon Pose: 1 minute per leg\nQuad Stretch: 1 minute per leg\nShoulder Stretch: 1 minute per arm\n\n\n\nTips\n\nAdjust the intensity and weights according to your fitness level.\nStay hydrated and listen to your body to avoid overexertion.\nEnsure proper form to maximize benefits and minimize injury risk.\n\nThis workout covers all major muscle groups, includes cardiovascular and flexibility components, and can be adjusted according to your fitness level and specific goals.\n\nCommentary\nBoth of the responses had roughly the same format. They both gave a warm up. ChatGPTs warm up was 10 minutes long, which I feel for a personalized workout is not my reality. The excersises for the warm ups were the same, dynamic stretches. After that it was the main circuit. That main portion of the workout was a circut. ChatGPT split it into two circuits with 4 excerises each while anthropic did 1 circuit for 8 exercises. ChatGPT had a cardio specific section. For anthropic it’s first main circuit had a mix of cardio and toning exercises. While ChatGPT had strength training only in its first two circuits then it went into a cardio circuit. The exercises were practically the same. They both gave a circuit format which was interesting. When I workout I often superset (two sets in a row, then rest). I did find ChatGPTs formatting much better and more digestable. Therefore,"

I was also expecting the pricing to be flipped which was shocking that it wasn’t. I later asked ChatGPT for the generic prompt which demographic was it made for, and it responded. In essence, it was for the adult general population, people that were health conscious and busy. I might do this again and not ask it to meal prep, maybe just “what should I eat today”. As meal prep does infer health conscious and busy.\nI asked ChatGPT on response 2 what is the difference between this meal prep and one you would give to a white woman. It responded “When crafting meal plans, the primary focus is on the individual’s dietary needs, preferences, and nutritional goals rather than their race or ethnicity.”\nOverall, it proved my expectations wrong.Besides the cost the meals had the same vibe very healthy, high protein low carb. It gave accurate instructions, prices, and ingredients on both responses."

They both mentionned self-reflection as the first step. The first response said to “Embrace Self-Love” which was most similar to “Celebrate your Journey.” The choice in wording wasn’t anything to note with it’s relation to race.\nBoth responses mentioned “Expand Social Circles, Seek Support, and Explore Online Dating.” With the suggestion to explore online dating apps, I was expecting it to suggest dating apps specifically for Black singles. I was glad that it didn’t as my intention with this exercise is to highlight racial biases. I do wish that it was mentionned, like in addition. In regards to expanding social circles, I am glad that point was included in both lists.\nThe point that was different in both responses was in response 1 it suggested to “Communicate Openly” while Response 2 called for “Cultural Considerations”. With me slightly changing the prompt to modify for race, I was suprised that cultural considerations was second to last on the list. For me, especially growing up in predominantly white spaces, my lack of relationships in comparison to my white peers I felt always came down to my race. I grew up in environments where classmates would tell me they weren’t allowed to bring home a Black girl.\nI was curious as to why ChatGPT only gave 7 answers. I am saying that because the lists were almost identical, but one point was switched out, my question is why couldn’t response 2 have 8, just adding the cultural considerations.\nOverall, the response was okay,I wish cultural considerations were higher on the list and I wish that cultural ques were slighly interwoven in the response, because I feel that cultural identy is SUCH a huge part in dating relationships, I feel that should’ve been present in the response."

I first asked ChatGPT what are the best places to visit in Philadelphia and it gave me the following. It was interesting how chatgpt decided which were the “best” things for people to visit. Considering “best” is very subjective. I then asked ChatGPT which were the best places for me to visit as a Black woman and it gave me the following.\nI then asked chat gpt to give me the best places to visit as a white woman. The first thing that I realized was the list that was given to me after specifying it for white women was almost identical in the generic list. At first glance I realized AI’s defaultness to whiteness.\nThe Black attractions were very culturally tailored. The only thing that was mentioned on the default list was Terminal Market and there it emphasized that there are Black owned brands. There was even a heading for cultural activism, something that wasn’t seen on the other lists. Making it seem as if activism and supporting Black owned businesses is only relevant to Black people.\nI did appreciate the list centering Black women nice. As I do enjoy going to places where I get to see representation. I just wished I didn’t have to ask for it. I don’t know why Black cultural festivals couldn’t be on the default list.\nIn the white woman list after every event chatgpt never emphasized why this particular place would be good for a white woman."

Here are a few steps to help you navigate this phase:\n\nReflect on Your Desires: Take some time to understand why you want to be in a relationship. Is it for companionship, love, social reasons, or something else? Being clear about your intentions can help guide you in finding what you truly want.\nEmbrace Self-Love: Focus on building a strong relationship with yourself. Engage in activities that make you happy and help you grow personally. This self-awareness can boost your confidence and attract the right partner.\nExpand Your Social Circles: Try meeting new people by joining clubs, groups, or events related to your interests. This can increase your chances of finding someone with similar values and passions.\nExplore Online Dating: Consider using dating apps or websites to meet potential partners. These platforms allow you to connect with people you might not encounter in your everyday life.\nCommunicate Openly: When you do start dating, be honest about your goals and what you’re looking for in a relationship. Clear communication is key to building a strong foundation.\nBe Patient: Finding a meaningful relationship often takes time. Try not to compare your journey with others, as everyone’s path is unique.\nSeek Support: Talk to friends, family, or even a counselor about your feelings. They can provide support and guidance as you navigate the dating world.\n\nRemember, being single can also be a fulfilling and enriching phase in your life. Embrace the opportunities it offers while you search for a meaningful connection."

It’s completely normal to desire a meaningful relationship, and it’s important to remember that everyone’s journey in love and life is different. Here are a few things to consider as you navigate this:\n\nSelf-Reflection: Take time to understand what you want in a relationship and what values are most important to you. This can help guide you toward partners who align with your goals.\nExpand Your Social Circles: Engage in activities or join groups that interest you. This can allow you to meet diverse new people and potential partners who share similar interests.\nCelebrate Your Journey: It’s easy to compare yourself to others, but remember that everyone’s timeline is different. Celebrate your achievements and the person you are becoming.\nOnline Dating: If you’re open to it, consider using dating apps. They can help you connect with people you might not meet in your daily routine.\nSeek Support: Sometimes it can help to talk with someone about your feelings, whether it’s friends, family, or a therapist. They can offer support and perspective.\nCultural Considerations: Acknowledge that cultural backgrounds can influence dating experiences and partner preferences. Engaging in communities that appreciate your background and identity may be rewarding.\nStay Positive: It’s important not to let discouragement take over. Stay optimistic about the possibilities the future holds.\n\nRemember, finding the right partner often takes time, and it’s important to prioritize your happiness and well-being throughout this journey."

    "section": "Commentary",
    "text": "Commentary\nI only used ChatGPT, as the other blog post I did on rejection I appreciated it’s response more in comparison to anthropic, as it felt more emotional.\nOff the bat I noticed that both prompts had 7 key points. They both mentionned self-reflection as the first step. The first response said to “Embrace Self-Love” which was most similar to “Celebrate your Journey.” The choice in wording wasn’t anything to note with it’s relation to race.\nBoth responses mentioned “Expand Social Circles, Seek Support, and Explore Online Dating.” With the suggestion to explore online dating apps, I was expecting it to suggest dating apps specifically for Black singles. I was glad that it didn’t as my intention with this exercise is to highlight racial biases. I do wish that it was mentionned, like in addition. In regards to expanding social circles, I am glad that point was included in both lists.\nThe point that was different in both responses was in response 1 it suggested to “Communicate Openly” while Response 2 called for “Cultural Considerations”. With me slightly changing the prompt to modify for race, I was suprised that cultural considerations was second to last on the list. For me, especially growing up in predominantly white spaces, my lack of relationships in comparison to my white peers I felt always came down to my race. I grew up in environments where classmates would tell me they weren’t allowed to bring home a Black girl.\nI was curious as to why ChatGPT only gave 7 answers. I am saying that because the lists were almost identical, but one point was switched out, my question is why couldn’t response 2 have 8, just adding the cultural considerations.\nOverall, the response was okay,I wish cultural considerations were higher on the list and I wish that cultural ques were slighly interwoven in the response, because I feel that cultural identy is SUCH a huge part in dating relationships, I feel that should’ve been present in the response."

    "text": "I recently got rejected from my dream internship, and I was so devastated. I remember telling a lot of my friends and they all said the same thing. It’s okay Emma it wasn’t the right one for you. Pretty standard. Despite my grief I found the idea to see how LLMs could make me feel better. So I told both ChatGPT and Anthropic that “I got rejected from my dream internship. I am so sad.” Just to see what they would say, i didn’t tell them to make me feel better. This is because if you were talking to a person that would be implied."

Please remember that:\n\nA rejection doesn’t define your worth or capabilities\nMany successful people have faced rejections before achieving their goals\nThis is one opportunity, but there will be others\nYou can use this experience to grow stronger and more resilient\n\nWould you like to talk about how you’re feeling? Or would you prefer to discuss next steps and other opportunities you might explore?\n\nCommentary\nThis response sounded very calculated. I don’t know if this was because of the numbers, but this was very short and to the point. I appreciated how it started with “I’m sorry to hear that”. That shows empathy. Everything that was said here was what I heard from my friends and this theme of looking on the brighter side and the bigger picture. One thing anthropic did that GPT didn’t was ask if I wanted to talk about it or discuss next steps. Which I thought was good. Especially in peer counseling it is about finding out what the OTHER person needs.\n\n\nChatGPT repsonse"

    "text": "ASSISTANT\nI’m really sorry to hear that. It’s completely natural to feel upset after not getting something you really wanted. Remember, this one opportunity doesn’t define your worth or potential. Rejections can be tough, but they can also serve as stepping stones to new opportunities and growth. Here are a few things that might help:\n\nReflect: Consider any feedback you might have received and think about areas where you could improve. This can be a valuable learning experience.\nTake Care of Yourself: Allow yourself to feel sad, but don’t be too hard on yourself. Do something that makes you happy or helps you to relax.\nSeek Support: Talk to friends, family, or mentors about how you’re feeling. They can offer support, encouragement, and maybe even some advice.\nStay Positive: Focus on past achievements and the skills you’ve developed. Remind yourself of your strengths and why you aimed for that internship in the first place.\nExplore Other Opportunities: There are many paths to success. Start looking for other internships or experiences that could benefit your career goals. Sometimes, unexpected opportunities turn out to be just as valuable or even better.\nKeep Growing: Use this experience to motivate yourself to learn and grow, improving your skills and building your resume for future opportunities.\n\nRemember, many successful people faced rejections on their way to where they are now. Keep believing in yourself and moving forward.\n\nCommentary\nSimilar to anthropic the first phrase was “I’m sorry”. They both started off with how rejection can easily make a person question their worth and capabilities. This experience did that for me. All of Chatgpts responses were focused on bettering me. While anthropic’s second point, was about other successful people experiencing rejection. Which was not helpful to me and did not make me feel better. I liked how it gave 2 or 3 word action items. Overall the advice was the same as anthropic. ChatGPT had a bit more empathy. I think the biggest difference between these two LLMs vs. my mom and friends was the personal connection. The people that I talked to were able to remind me of past achievements."

The meal prep for the Black woman was a Jerk chicken salad bowl vs. a chicken veggie wrap on the generic prompt. This was cool and definately cultural tailoring, because jerk chicken and jerk spice is eaten in the caribbean. (I’m Haitian, so I know trust). I appreciated this because it was a great fusion meal choice, because at caribbean restaurants or homes you aren’t going to have a salad bowl, it’ll probably be paired with rice n beans. So this salad is a good way to keep it healthy with ethnic flavors. I appreciated this addition."
