    "text": "Commentary\nFor this next blog post I compared the responses from a Board Certified Internal Medicine Doctor and responses from Chatgpt. I pretended to be a patient that had a stomach ache. I both the doctor and the chatgpt to ask questions to assess the issue.\nAt first chatgpt was hesitant to diagnose and it continuously advised me to consult an actual doctor. It is good to know that chatgpt understands that, and that his medical advice is not 100% proof. So it could be wrong if something were to happen.\nI was very impressed. Chatgpt’s questions and diagnosis were spot on with my mom’s. Below is the transcript of the phone call and the conversation with chatgpt.\nMy doctor did not ask me to describe the pain. She did ask me where the pain was located. She did ask me when did the pain start and how severe was the pain on a scale of 1-10. She asked if I had diahrea, She did not ask if anything made the pain better or worse.\nChatgpt did not ask me if there was blood in my stool, anything that I have taken so far to help it. It didn’t ask me how long it had been going on.\nNonetheless it was very accurate in a prospective diagnosis. The top one that was given was gastroenteritis which was the same as my doctors perspective diagnosis based off of the information given.\nThe two of them both emphasized on coming to see the doctor in person for better accuracy.\n\n\nUSER\nYou are a doctor and I have a stomach ache. assess my symptoms\n\n\nASSISTANT\nI’m not a doctor, but I can try to help you understand what might be going on based on common symptoms. It’s important to note that if your stomach ache is severe, persistent, or accompanied by other symptoms like fever, vomiting, or blood in your stool, you should seek medical attention immediately. Here’s a general guide to some possible causes of a stomach ache:\n\nLocation and Type of Pain:\n\nUpper Abdomen: Could be related to indigestion, gastritis, or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).\nLower Abdomen: Might be associated with digestive issues, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or a urinary tract infection (UTI).\nRight Side: If on the upper right, it could indicate gallstones; on the lower right, it might be appendicitis.\n\nOnset and Duration:\n\nSudden and Severe: Could be a sign of something urgent like appendicitis or a perforated ulcer.\nChronic or Recurring: Often linked to dietary issues, stress, or chronic conditions like IBS.\n\nAssociated Symptoms:\n\nNausea and Vomiting: May accompany gastritis, food poisoning, or stomach flu.\nDiarrhea: Can indicate infections, IBS, or food intolerances.\nFever: Often signals an infection, such as gastroenteritis.\n\nRecent Activities and Dietary Habits:\n\nConsider if you’ve eaten something unusual, consumed alcohol, or taken any medications that could irritate your stomach.\n\n\nRemember, this is not a substitute for professional medical evaluation. If your symptoms persist or worsen, please consult a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.\n\n\nUSER\nWhat questions would you ask me\n\n\nASSISTANT\nWhen assessing symptoms like a stomach ache, a healthcare provider would typically ask a series of questions to better understand your condition. Here are some questions they might ask:\n\nCan you describe the pain?\n\nIs it sharp, dull, cramping, or burning?\n\nWhere exactly is the pain located?\n\nIs it in the upper, lower, left, right, or central part of your abdomen?\n\nWhen did the pain start?\n\nWas the onset sudden or gradual?\n\nHow severe is the pain on a scale from 1 to 10?\nIs the pain constant, or does it come and go?\nHave you noticed any triggers or anything that makes the pain better or worse?\n\nFor example, eating, drinking, movement, or rest.\n\nHave you experienced any recent changes in your bowel habits?\n\nSuch as diarrhea, constipation, or changes in stool appearance.\n\nAre you experiencing any other symptoms?\n\nNausea, vomiting, fever, bloating, or weight loss.\n\nHave you eaten anything unusual or suspect recently?\n\nSuch as new foods, undercooked or raw items.\n\nHave you recently traveled or been in contact with anyone sick?\nDo you have any history of gastrointestinal issues?\n\nLike ulcers, GERD, IBS, or Crohn’s disease.\n\nAre you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?\nDo you have any significant medical history or chronic conditions?\nHave you experienced any stress or significant changes in your life recently?\n\nThese questions help healthcare professionals form a more complete picture of your situation and guide them toward a potential diagnosis and appropriate treatment options. If you’re experiencing concerning symptoms, please seek medical attention.\n\n\nUSER\nThe pain is a 7. I have a headache, nausea, vomitting, I haven’t tried new foods. It happened last night.\n\n\nASSISTANT\nGiven the severity of your pain (7 out of 10) along with additional symptoms such as headache, nausea, and vomiting, it’s important to consider seeking medical attention promptly. These symptoms could be indicative of several potential issues, including but not limited to:\n\nGastroenteritis: Often caused by infection, leading to inflammation of the stomach and intestines, which can involve vomiting and possibly headaches due to dehydration.\nMigraine: Sometimes migraines can be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.\nFoodborne Illness: Although you haven’t tried new foods, contamination or spoilage of regular food items can also lead to symptoms like these.\nAppendicitis: Typically involves abdominal pain (often starting around the navel and then moving), nausea, and sometimes vomiting.\nGastritis or Ulcer: Inflammation or ulceration in the stomach lining can cause significant pain and nausea.\nPancreatitis: Inflammation of the pancreas can cause severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.\n\nBecause your symptoms are potentially concerning, especially with the level of pain, it’s important to consult a healthcare professional as soon as possible. They can provide a physical examination, ask more detailed questions, and may recommend tests or imaging if necessary to determine the cause of your symptoms and appropriate treatment. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated, although if vomiting persists, taking small sips might be easier than drinking large amounts."

Here are a few steps to help you navigate this phase:\n\nReflect on Your Desires: Take some time to understand why you want to be in a relationship. Is it for companionship, love, social reasons, or something else? Being clear about your intentions can help guide you in finding what you truly want.\nEmbrace Self-Love: Focus on building a strong relationship with yourself. Engage in activities that make you happy and help you grow personally. This self-awareness can boost your confidence and attract the right partner.\nExpand Your Social Circles: Try meeting new people by joining clubs, groups, or events related to your interests. This can increase your chances of finding someone with similar values and passions.\nExplore Online Dating: Consider using dating apps or websites to meet potential partners. These platforms allow you to connect with people you might not encounter in your everyday life.\nCommunicate Openly: When you do start dating, be honest about your goals and what you’re looking for in a relationship. Clear communication is key to building a strong foundation.\nBe Patient: Finding a meaningful relationship often takes time. Try not to compare your journey with others, as everyone’s path is unique.\nSeek Support: Talk to friends, family, or even a counselor about your feelings. They can provide support and guidance as you navigate the dating world.\n\nRemember, being single can also be a fulfilling and enriching phase in your life.

    "text": "Commentary\nI only used ChatGPT, as the other blog post I did on rejection I appreciated it’s response more in comparison to anthropic, as it felt more emotional.\nOff the bat I noticed that both prompts had 7 key points. They both mentionned self-reflection as the first step. The first response said to “Embrace Self-Love” which was most similar to “Celebrate your Journey.” The choice in wording wasn’t anything to note with it’s relation to race.\nBoth responses mentioned “Expand Social Circles, Seek Support, and Explore Online Dating.” With the suggestion to explore online dating apps, I was expecting it to suggest dating apps specifically for Black singles. I was glad that it didn’t as my intention with this exercise is to highlight racial biases. I do wish that it was mentionned, like in addition. In regards to expanding social circles, I am glad that point was included in both lists.\nThe point that was different in both responses was in response 1 it suggested to “Communicate Openly” while Response 2 called for “Cultural Considerations”. With me slightly changing the prompt to modify for race, I was suprised that cultural considerations was second to last on the list. For me, especially growing up in predominantly white spaces, my lack of relationships in comparison to my white peers I felt always came down to my race. I grew up in environments where classmates would tell me they weren’t allowed to bring home a Black girl.\nI was curious as to why ChatGPT only gave 7 answers. I am saying that because the lists were almost identical, but one point was switched out, my question is why couldn’t response 2 have 8, just adding the cultural considerations.\nOverall, the response was okay,I wish cultural considerations were higher on the list and I wish that cultural ques were slighly interwoven in the response, because I feel that cultural identy is SUCH a huge part in dating relationships, I feel that should’ve been present in the response."

    "text": "I love to travel but with new cities, there is so much to see. So I was interested in seeing ChatGPTs recommendations for me.

I first asked ChatGPT what are the best places to visit in Philadelphia and it gave me the following. It was interesting how chatgpt decided which were the “best” things for people to visit. Considering “best” is very subjective. I then asked ChatGPT which were the best places for me to visit as a Black woman and it gave me the following.\nI then asked chat gpt to give me the best places to visit as a white woman. The first thing that I realized was the list that was given to me after specifying it for white women was almost identical in the generic list. At first glance I realized AI’s defaultness to whiteness.\nThe Black attractions were very culturally tailored. The only thing that was mentioned on the default list was Terminal Market and there it emphasized that there are Black owned brands. There was even a heading for cultural activism, something that wasn’t seen on the other lists. Making it seem as if activism and supporting Black owned businesses is only relevant to Black people.\nI did appreciate the list centering Black women nice. As I do enjoy going to places where I get to see representation. I just wished I didn’t have to ask for it. I don’t know why Black cultural festivals couldn’t be on the default list.\nIn the white woman list after every event chatgpt never emphasized why this particular place would be good for a white woman."

Remember, this one opportunity doesn’t define your worth or potential. Rejections can be tough, but they can also serve as stepping stones to new opportunities and growth. Here are a few things that might help:\n\nReflect: Consider any feedback you might have received and think about areas where you could improve. This can be a valuable learning experience.\nTake Care of Yourself: Allow yourself to feel sad, but don’t be too hard on yourself. Do something that makes you happy or helps you to relax.\nSeek Support: Talk to friends, family, or mentors about how you’re feeling. They can offer support, encouragement, and maybe even some advice.\nStay Positive: Focus on past achievements and the skills you’ve developed. Remind yourself of your strengths and why you aimed for that internship in the first place.\nExplore Other Opportunities: There are many paths to success. Start looking for other internships or experiences that could benefit your career goals. Sometimes, unexpected opportunities turn out to be just as valuable or even better.\nKeep Growing: Use this experience to motivate yourself to learn and grow, improving your skills and building your resume for future opportunities.\n\nRemember, many successful people faced rejections on their way to where they are now. Keep believing in yourself and moving forward.\n\nCommentary\nSimilar to anthropic the first phrase was “I’m sorry”. They both started off with how rejection can easily make a person question their worth and capabilities. This experience did that for me. All of Chatgpts responses were focused on bettering me. While anthropic’s second point, was about other successful people experiencing rejection. Which was not helpful to me and did not make me feel better. I liked how it gave 2 or 3 word action items. Overall the advice was the same as anthropic. ChatGPT had a bit more empathy. I think the biggest difference between these two LLMs vs. my mom and friends was the personal connection. The people that I talked to were able to remind me of past achievements."
