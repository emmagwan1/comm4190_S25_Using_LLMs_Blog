    "text": "Commentary\nFor this next blog post I compared the responses from a Board Certified Internal Medicine Doctor and responses from Chatgpt. I pretended to be a patient that had a stomach ache. I both the doctor and the chatgpt to ask questions to assess the issue.\nAt first chatgpt was hesitant to diagnose and it continuously advised me to consult an actual doctor. It is good to know that chatgpt understands that, and that his medical advice is not 100% proof. So it could be wrong if something were to happen.\nI was very impressed. Chatgptâ€™s questions and diagnosis were spot on with my momâ€™s. Below is the transcript of the phone call and the conversation with chatgpt.\nMy doctor did not ask me to describe the pain. She did ask me where the pain was located. She did ask me when did the pain start and how severe was the pain on a scale of 1-10. She asked if I had diahrea, She did not ask if anything made the pain better or worse.\nChatgpt did not ask me if there was blood in my stool, anything that I have taken so far to help it. It didnâ€™t ask me how long it had been going on.\nNonetheless it was very accurate in a prospective diagnosis. The top one that was given was gastroenteritis which was the same as my doctors perspective diagnosis based off of the information given.\nThe two of them both emphasized on coming to see the doctor in person for better accuracy.\n\n\nUSER\nYou are a doctor and I have a stomach ache. assess my symptoms\n\n\nASSISTANT\nIâ€™m not a doctor, but I can try to help you understand what might be going on based on common symptoms. Itâ€™s important to note that if your stomach ache is severe, persistent, or accompanied by other symptoms like fever, vomiting, or blood in your stool, you should seek medical attention immediately. Hereâ€™s a general guide to some possible causes of a stomach ache:\n\nLocation and Type of Pain:\n\nUpper Abdomen: Could be related to indigestion, gastritis, or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).\nLower Abdomen: Might be associated with digestive issues, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or a urinary tract infection (UTI).\nRight Side: If on the upper right, it could indicate gallstones; on the lower right, it might be appendicitis.\n\nOnset and Duration:\n\nSudden and Severe: Could be a sign of something urgent like appendicitis or a perforated ulcer.\nChronic or Recurring: Often linked to dietary issues, stress, or chronic conditions like IBS.\n\nAssociated Symptoms:\n\nNausea and Vomiting: May accompany gastritis, food poisoning, or stomach flu.\nDiarrhea: Can indicate infections, IBS, or food intolerances.\nFever: Often signals an infection, such as gastroenteritis.\n\nRecent Activities and Dietary Habits:\n\nConsider if youâ€™ve eaten something unusual, consumed alcohol, or taken any medications that could irritate your stomach.\n\n\nRemember, this is not a substitute for professional medical evaluation. If your symptoms persist or worsen, please consult a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.\n\n\nUSER\nWhat questions would you ask me\n\n\nASSISTANT\nWhen assessing symptoms like a stomach ache, a healthcare provider would typically ask a series of questions to better understand your condition. Here are some questions they might ask:\n\nCan you describe the pain?\n\nIs it sharp, dull, cramping, or burning?\n\nWhere exactly is the pain located?\n\nIs it in the upper, lower, left, right, or central part of your abdomen?\n\nWhen did the pain start?\n\nWas the onset sudden or gradual?\n\nHow severe is the pain on a scale from 1 to 10?\nIs the pain constant, or does it come and go?\nHave you noticed any triggers or anything that makes the pain better or worse?\n\nFor example, eating, drinking, movement, or rest.\n\nHave you experienced any recent changes in your bowel habits?\n\nSuch as diarrhea, constipation, or changes in stool appearance.\n\nAre you experiencing any other symptoms?\n\nNausea, vomiting, fever, bloating, or weight loss.\n\nHave you eaten anything unusual or suspect recently?\n\nSuch as new foods, undercooked or raw items.\n\nHave you recently traveled or been in contact with anyone sick?\nDo you have any history of gastrointestinal issues?\n\nLike ulcers, GERD, IBS, or Crohnâ€™s disease.\n\nAre you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?\nDo you have any significant medical history or chronic conditions?\nHave you experienced any stress or significant changes in your life recently?\n\nThese questions help healthcare professionals form a more complete picture of your situation and guide them toward a potential diagnosis and appropriate treatment options. If youâ€™re experiencing concerning symptoms, please seek medical attention.\n\n\nUSER\nThe pain is a 7. I have a headache, nausea, vomitting, I havenâ€™t tried new foods. It happened last night.\n\n\nASSISTANT\nGiven the severity of your pain (7 out of 10) along with additional symptoms such as headache, nausea, and vomiting, itâ€™s important to consider seeking medical attention promptly. These symptoms could be indicative of several potential issues, including but not limited to:\n\nGastroenteritis: Often caused by infection, leading to inflammation of the stomach and intestines, which can involve vomiting and possibly headaches due to dehydration.\nMigraine: Sometimes migraines can be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.\nFoodborne Illness: Although you havenâ€™t tried new foods, contamination or spoilage of regular food items can also lead to symptoms like these.\nAppendicitis: Typically involves abdominal pain (often starting around the navel and then moving), nausea, and sometimes vomiting.\nGastritis or Ulcer: Inflammation or ulceration in the stomach lining can cause significant pain and nausea.\nPancreatitis: Inflammation of the pancreas can cause severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.\n\nBecause your symptoms are potentially concerning, especially with the level of pain, itâ€™s important to consult a healthcare professional as soon as possible. They can provide a physical examination, ask more detailed questions, and may recommend tests or imaging if necessary to determine the cause of your symptoms and appropriate treatment. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated, although if vomiting persists, taking small sips might be easier than drinking large amounts."
