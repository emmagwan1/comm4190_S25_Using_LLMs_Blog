    "Both of the responses had roughly the same format. They both gave a warm up. ChatGPTs warm up was 10 minutes long, which I feel for a personalized workout is not my reality. The excersises for the warm ups were the same, dynamic stretches. After that it was the main circuit. That main portion of the workout was a circut. ChatGPT split it into two circuits with 4 excerises each while anthropic did 1 circuit for 8 exercises. ChatGPT had a cardio specific section. For anthropic it's first main circuit had a mix of cardio and toning exercises. While ChatGPT had strength training only in its first two circuits then it went into a cardio circuit. The exercises were practically the same. They both gave a circuit format which was interesting. When I workout I often superset (two sets in a row, then rest). I did find ChatGPTs formatting much better and more digestable. Therefore, in the future I will probably go with ChatGPT. "
