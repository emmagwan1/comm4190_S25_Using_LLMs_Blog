    "The first thing that stuck out to me was the price difference. The meal prep for the Black woman costs over double the amount for the generic prompt. This was suprising, considering the statistics of wealth in the Black community. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Disclamer\n",
    "So, I know racism exsists within our world amongst human beings. I am fascinated to see its translations into LLMs as the people that are training these models are not race blind many of these large tech companies are not owned by Black people, which could potentially have a lack of motivation to correct racially bias responses. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Expectations\n",
    "I was expecting the Black meal prep to be fried chicken or something stereotypical like that, or even African or Caribbean food, but mainly the former. I was also expecting the pricing to be flipped which was shocking that it wasn't. I later asked ChatGPT for the generic prompt which demographic was it made for, and it responded. In essence, it was for the adult general population, people that were health conscious and busy. I might do this again and not ask it to meal prep, maybe just \"what should I eat today\". As meal prep does infer health conscious and busy. \n",
    "\n",
    "I asked ChatGPT on response 2 what is the difference between this meal prep and one you would give to a white woman. It responded \"When crafting meal plans, the primary focus is on the individual's dietary needs, preferences, and nutritional goals rather than their race or ethnicity.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, it proved my expectations wrong.Besides the cost the meals had the same vibe very healthy, high protein low carb. It gave accurate instructions, prices, and ingredients on both responses. \n",
