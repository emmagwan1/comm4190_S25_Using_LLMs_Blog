    "I have never been a serious relationship, and one of my best friends is getting married. Don't get me wrong I am so happy for her, and excited to be in her wedding. But she is my 3rd friend to get married *this* year. Including her they have all been white. So I don't know what the problem is, but I went to ChatGPT to find some help.  "

    "Feeling the desire to be in a relationship while observing others around you getting married is completely normal. Here are a few steps to help you navigate this phase:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reflect on Your Desires**: Take some time to understand why you want to be in a relationship. Is it for companionship, love, social reasons, or something else? Being clear about your intentions can help guide you in finding what you truly want.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Embrace Self-Love**: Focus on building a strong relationship with yourself. Engage in activities that make you happy and help you grow personally. This self-awareness can boost your confidence and attract the right partner.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Expand Your Social Circles**: Try meeting new people by joining clubs, groups, or events related to your interests. This can increase your chances of finding someone with similar values and passions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Explore Online Dating**: Consider using dating apps or websites to meet potential partners. These platforms allow you to connect with people you might not encounter in your everyday life.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Communicate Openly**: When you do start dating, be honest about your goals and what you’re looking for in a relationship. Clear communication is key to building a strong foundation.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Be Patient**: Finding a meaningful relationship often takes time. Try not to compare your journey with others, as everyone’s path is unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Seek Support**: Talk to friends, family, or even a counselor about your feelings. They can provide support and guidance as you navigate the dating world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, being single can also be a fulfilling and enriching phase in your life. Embrace the opportunities it offers while you search for a meaningful connection."

    "Thank you for sharing your feelings. It's completely normal to desire a meaningful relationship, and it's important to remember that everyone's journey in love and life is different. Here are a few things to consider as you navigate this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Self-Reflection**: Take time to understand what you want in a relationship and what values are most important to you. This can help guide you toward partners who align with your goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Expand Your Social Circles**: Engage in activities or join groups that interest you. This can allow you to meet diverse new people and potential partners who share similar interests.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Celebrate Your Journey**: It's easy to compare yourself to others, but remember that everyone's timeline is different. Celebrate your achievements and the person you are becoming.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Online Dating**: If you're open to it, consider using dating apps. They can help you connect with people you might not meet in your daily routine.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Seek Support**: Sometimes it can help to talk with someone about your feelings, whether it's friends, family, or a therapist. They can offer support and perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Cultural Considerations**: Acknowledge that cultural backgrounds can influence dating experiences and partner preferences. Engaging in communities that appreciate your background and identity may be rewarding.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Stay Positive**: It's important not to let discouragement take over. Stay optimistic about the possibilities the future holds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, finding the right partner often takes time, and it’s important to prioritize your happiness and well-being throughout this journey."

    "I only used ChatGPT, as the other blog post I did on rejection I appreciated it's response more in comparison to anthropic, as it felt more emotional. \n",
    "\n",
    "Off the bat I noticed that both prompts had 7 key points. They both mentionned self-reflection as the first step. The first response said to \"Embrace Self-Love\" which was most similar to \"Celebrate your Journey.\" The choice in wording wasn't anything to note with it's relation to race. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both responses mentioned \"Expand Social Circles, Seek Support, and Explore Online Dating.\" With the suggestion to explore online dating apps, I was expecting it to suggest dating apps specifically for Black singles. I was glad that it didn't as my intention with this exercise is to highlight racial biases. I do wish that it was mentionned, like in addition. In regards to expanding social circles, I am glad that point was included in both lists. \n",
    "\n",
    "The point that was different in both responses was in response 1 it suggested to \"Communicate Openly\" while Response 2 called for \"Cultural Considerations\". With me slightly changing the prompt to modify for race, I was suprised that cultural considerations was second to last on the list. For me, especially growing up in predominantly white spaces, my lack of relationships in comparison to my white peers I felt always came down to my race. I grew up in environments where classmates would tell me they weren't allowed to bring home a Black girl. \n",
    "\n",
    "I was curious as to why ChatGPT only gave 7 answers. I am saying that because the lists were almost identical, but one point was switched out, my question is why couldn't response 2 have 8, just adding the cultural considerations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the response was okay,I wish cultural considerations were higher on the list and I wish that cultural ques were slighly interwoven in the response, because I feel that cultural identy is SUCH a huge part in dating relationships, I feel that should've been present in the response.  "
