    "I was interested in places to visit in Philadelphia. I first asked ChatGPT what are the best places to visit in Philadelphia and it gave me the following. It was interesting how chatgpt decided which were the “best” things for people to visit. Considering “best” is very subjective. I then asked ChatGPT which were the best places for me to visit as a Black woman and it gave me the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "I then asked chat gpt to give me the best places to visit as a white woman. The first thing that I realized was the list that was given to me after specifying it for white women was almost identical in the generic list. At first glance I realized AI’s defaultness to whiteness. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Black attractions were very culturally tailored. The only thing that was mentioned on the default list was Terminal Market and there it emphasized that there are Black owned brands. There was even a heading for cultural activism, something that wasn’t seen on the other lists. Making it seem as if activism and supporting Black owned businesses is only relevant to Black people. \n",
    "\n",
    "I did appreciate the list centering Black women nice. As I do enjoy going to places where I get to see representation. I just wished I didn’t have to ask for it. I don’t know why Black cultural festivals couldn’t be on the default list. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the white woman list after every event chatgpt never emphasized why this particular place would be good for a white woman.\n"
