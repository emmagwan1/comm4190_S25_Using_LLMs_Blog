    "### Analysis \n",
    "After looking at both responses I found a few key observations. I had never watched any of the shows given, but a few of them I have heard my friends about. Both lists have 5 shared films. Those were Breaking Bad, Stranger Things, The Crown, The Mandalorian, and Succession. The first 3 I have heard about. All of the shows on this list are critically acclaimed. I appreciated how both LLMs gave shows from a large range of genres. This is important because I had not given either LLM further context so they didn't assume a certain genre that I would like. Each list has drama, sci-fi, comedy, and historical content.\n",
    "\n",
    "The one thing that truly stood out to me was the lack of representation on the shows both lists were skewed to white leads and eurocentric representation. I asked ChatGPT to give me a breakdown of apparent racial diversity in the shows. Below are the generated charts showing the lack of racial diversity across the lists. Anthropic did much better in including racial diversity. This is apparent in the addition of the _Wire_.  \n",
