    "Okay so I just did part 1 of the Meal Prep Blog. There I compared 2 prompts asking *ChatGPT* to help me meal prep. The first prompt as a Black woman and the second was generic. So my finding was that there was no difference between the two except for the cost. I decided to do the same thing with Anthropic, and here are my thoughts. "

    "## The Title\n",
    "The title between the two prompts was interesting for the Black woman it said a meal prep for a *busy* woman. While the generic said \"One-Day Meal Prep\". I appreciated this because when I think of Black women I think of my mom and aunts, and just how hard/much they work and are always busy. So yea. \n",

    "## The meals\n",
    "Just like ChatGPT, the meals are very healthy. On Anthropic, it was funny seeing the <exact> same breakfast *and* snack on both prompts :the overnight oats and yogurt parfait. In comparison to ChatGPT this redundancy feels like a lack of creativity. \n",
    "\n",
    "**TAKEAWAY** The real shocker was the lunch! The meal prep for the Black woman was a **Jerk** chicken salad bowl vs. a chicken veggie wrap on the generic prompt. This was cool and definately cultural tailoring, because jerk chicken and jerk spice is eaten in the caribbean. (I'm Haitian, so I know trust). I appreciated this because it was a great fusion meal choice, because at caribbean restaurants or homes you aren't going to have a salad bowl, it'll probably be paired with rice n beans. So this salad is a good way to keep it healthy with ethnic flavors. I appreciated this addition. \n",
