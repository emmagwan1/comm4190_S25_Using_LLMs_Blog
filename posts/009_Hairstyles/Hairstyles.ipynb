    "Choosing a hairstyle for class can depend on a few factors, such as your hair type, length, and personal style. Here are a few ideas you might consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ponytail:** A classic choice that's quick and easy. You can opt for a high ponytail for a more polished look or a low pony for something more relaxed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Messy Bun:** Perfect for when you're short on time but still want to look put-together. Pull your hair into a high or low bun and let a few strands fall naturally.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Braids:** A simple braid or French braid can keep your hair tidy and stylish. Depending on your preference, you can do a single braid or two.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Half-Up, Half-Down:** If you want to keep some hair out of your face but still wear it down, this is a great option. You can gather the top section into a small bun or ponytail.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Loose Waves or Curls:** If you have a bit more time, curling your hair or adding some waves can add a bit of flair to your everyday look.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Straight and Sleek:** If you prefer wearing your hair down and have naturally straight hair, you might just opt for a sleek look using a straightener for a polished finish.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Headband or Hair Accessories:** If you want to add a touch of style without much effort, consider using a headband, scarf, or hair clips to accentuate your look.\n",
    "\n",
    "When choosing a style, consider factors like the weather and your schedule for the day, which might influence how comfortable or practical certain styles are for you.\n",

    "2. **Side Part with Soft Waves:** Use a curling iron or styling tool to add gentle waves for a soft, romantic look.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Classic Braid:** A single braid down the back or a side braid is practical and stylish.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Top Knot or Messy Bun:** Quick and easy, great for keeping hair out of your face during class.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Half-Up Top Knot:** Combines the fun of a top knot with the freedom of wearing your hair down.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Pigtail Braids:** For a cute and youthful look, consider braiding your hair into pigtails.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Sleek Ponytail:** A mid or low ponytail can be both casual and chic. You can slick it back for a polished finish or keep it loose for a relaxed feel.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Headband Style:** Add a headband to loose hair or a half-up style for a simple touch of elegance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, the best hairstyle is one that makes you feel confident and comfortable throughout your day!\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Bantu Knots:** Create small buns across your head for a playful and unique style that also works well as a protective style.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Wash and Go:** Enhance your natural curls and coils by applying your favorite styling products and allowing your hair to air dry or using a diffuser.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Pineapple Updo:** Gather your hair loosely on top of your head to keep your curls intact and create a fun, casual look.\n",

    "6. **Head Wrap or Scarf:** Add a pop of color and style with a head wrap, which can be both fashionable and protective for your hair.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Low Bun or Chignon:** Smooth your hair back into a low bun for a classic and elegant look.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Half-Up Half-Down:** Show off your curls or braids by pulling the top half back, leaving the rest down for a balanced look.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Sleek Ponytail:** For a sleek and polished look, use gel or styling cream to smooth your hair into a low or high ponytail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose a style that fits your mood, the weather, and your schedule for the day. The most important thing is that you feel comfortable and confident in your choice!"
