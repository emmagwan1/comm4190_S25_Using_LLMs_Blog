    "I was pleased with both responses. What I noticed first was Anthropic did not add details as to what I should do the day of the wedding as well as afterward. It also seemed very formulaic, especially with the short bullet points. Both LLMs congratulated me on my \"engagement\" and acknowledged the emotions that wedding planning can evoke. Which was good and mimicked human conversation. ChatGPT assumed that a woman was asking for advice as in the 9-12 months section is said to find a **wedding dress** while anthropic said to find wedding **attire**. There was a difference in advice in the 6-9 months before category. The only thing that was the same in that category was register for gifts. Save the date,honeymoon planning, was on section off( by section I am referring to the month suggestions). One thing I felt was interesting that anthropic did not add to plan the wedding ceremony anywhere in its advice. One thing I would like to note with the 6-9 month timeline and the save the date and honeymoon planning being slightly off is potentially those things could be on the cusp. Anthropic also did not go into what to do the day of the wedding or up to two months before. This is interesting and I would of appreciated if anthropic would have included that without additional prompting. In conclusion I appreciated ChatGPTs response more as it is more thorough. "
